    "## Understanding Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "Arrays are those super useful containers that let programmers keep a bunch of related stuff together in one place. If variables are like single boxes, think of arrays as those shoe organizers where each slot holds something different.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What's an Array?\n",
    "\n",
    "At its core, an array is just:\n",
    "- A collection of values (could be numbers, text, whatever)\n",
    "- Organized in a sequence so you can find things easily\n",
    "- Perfect when you need to work with multiple related items\n",
    "\n",
    "Many beginners get confused about why arrays are even necessary. But try keeping track of 20 student scores with individual variables... yeah, not fun. Arrays make this kind of thing way easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Arrays Work\n",
    "\n",
    "Arrays have a few key features that make them useful:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Index numbers** - Each item has a position (starting at 0, which trips everyone up at first!)\n",
    "2. **Order matters** - Items stay in the sequence you put them in\n",
    "3. **Dynamic size** - Most languages let you add or remove items as needed\n",
    "4. **Versatility** - Can hold pretty much any type of data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Picturing an Array\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it like a row of mailboxes:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Index:   0      1      2       3        4\n",
    "       ┌────┐ ┌────┐ ┌────┐ ┌────┐  ┌────┐\n",
    "Array: │ 10 │ │ 20 │ │ 30 │ │ 40 │  │ 50 │\n",
    "       └────┘ └────┘ └────┘ └────┘  └────┘\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Working With Arrays in JavaScript\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Creating Arrays\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "// Empty array - for when you want to fill it later\n",
    "let emptyArray = [];\n",
    "\n",
    "// Array with values ready to go\n",
    "let numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];\n",
    "\n",
    "// Mix and match different types (though usually better to keep similar types together)\n",
    "let stuff = [\"apple\", 42, true, { name: \"Alex\" }];\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Getting Items Out\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "let fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\", \"date\"];\n",
    "\n",
    "// Get the first fruit\n",
    "console.log(fruits[0]); // \"apple\"\n",
    "\n",
    "// Get the third fruit\n",
    "console.log(fruits[2]); // \"cherry\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Changing Things Around\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "let colors = [\"red\", \"green\", \"blue\"];\n",
    "\n",
    "// Change the middle color\n",
    "colors[1] = \"yellow\";\n",
    "console.log(colors); // [\"red\", \"yellow\", \"blue\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "// Add a new color at the end\n",
    "colors.push(\"purple\");\n",
    "console.log(colors); // [\"red\", \"yellow\", \"blue\", \"purple\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "// Take away the last color\n",
    "colors.pop();\n",
    "console.log(colors); // [\"red\", \"yellow\", \"blue\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How Many Items?\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "let team = [\"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Charlie\", \"David\"];\n",
    "console.log(team.length); // 4\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Handy Array Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some methods that are commonly used:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Method | What it does | Example |\n",
    "|--------|-------------|---------|\n",
    "| push() | Adds to end | `array.push(item)` |\n",
    "| pop() | Removes from end | `array.pop()` |\n",
    "| unshift() | Adds to start | `array.unshift(item)` |\n",
    "| shift() | Removes from start | `array.shift()` |\n",
    "| slice() | Grabs a section | `array.slice(1,3)` |\n",
    "| join() | Makes a string | `array.join(\", \")` |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Arrays Are Great\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Saves time**: No need for 50 different variable names\n",
    "- **Makes sense**: Keeps related data together where it belongs\n",
    "- **Easy access**: Grab any item whenever you need it\n",
    "- **Loops**: Perfect for doing the same operation on multiple items\n",
    "- **Flexible**: Need to add more? No problem!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real Stuff You'd Store in Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Shopping list**: `[\"milk\", \"eggs\", \"bread\", \"coffee\"]`\n",
    "2. **Test scores**: `[95, 82, 78, 90, 88]`\n",
    "3. **User info**: `[\"Sarah\", 25, \"Web Developer\", true]`\n",
    "4. **Game coordinates**: `[[2,3], [4,1], [7,5], [0,2]]`\n",
    "\n",
    "Once programmers get comfortable with arrays, they use them everywhere!"

    "## Time to Practice: Array Challenges!\n",
    "\n",
    "Now it's time to put the concepts into practice! These challenges will help students get comfortable with arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"challenge-card\">\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hack #1: The Food Array\n",
    "\n",
    "For this first challenge, students will work with something everyone enjoys - food! The task is to create a list of favorite foods and manipulate the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What to do**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Make a food list**: \n",
    "   - Create a variable called `favoriteFoods`\n",
    "   - Put 5 favorite foods in there as strings\n",
    "   - For example: `let favoriteFoods = [\"pizza\", \"ice cream\", \"sushi\", \"tacos\", \"pasta\"];`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Find a specific food**:\n",
    "   - Get the first food from the list using its index\n",
    "   - Print it out with console.log()\n",
    "   - Remember that arrays start counting at 0, not 1\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Change something**:\n",
    "   - Change the third food in the array\n",
    "   - Replace it with something else using: `favoriteFoods[2] = \"something else\";`\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Add a dessert**:\n",
    "   - Use push() to add one more food to the end\n",
    "   - Example: `favoriteFoods.push(\"chocolate\");`\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Count the foods**:\n",
    "   - Check how many foods are now in the list\n",
    "   - Use the length property and print it out\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **See the results**:\n",
    "   - Print out the whole array to see all the changes\n",
    "   - Try: `console.log(\"My favorite foods are now: \", favoriteFoods);`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected output**: The code should display the first food, then the new total number of foods (should be 6), and finally the complete updated food list.\n",
    "\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be completed in the next code cell. Remember that making mistakes is part of the learning process!"

    "### Bonus Challenge Explained\n",
    "\n",
    "The bonus challenge asks students to add a new food at the FRONT of the list instead of the end. This requires the `unshift()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How `unshift()` works**:\n",
    "- It adds elements to the beginning of an array\n",
    "- It's similar to cutting in line at a movie theater\n",
    "- It returns how many items are now in the array\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it differs from `push()`:**\n",
    "- `push()` adds to the end (like joining the back of a line)\n",
    "- `unshift()` adds to the beginning (like cutting to the front)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example code:**\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "// Starting with a food list\n",
    "console.log(favoriteFoods); // [\"pizza\", \"ice cream\", \"burgers\", \"tacos\", \"pasta\", \"chocolate\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "// Adding \"waffles\" to the beginning\n",
    "favoriteFoods.unshift(\"waffles\");\n",
    "\n",
    "// Result\n",
    "console.log(favoriteFoods); // [\"waffles\", \"pizza\", \"ice cream\", \"burgers\", \"tacos\", \"pasta\", \"chocolate\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**What happens behind the scenes:**\n",
    "When an element is added to the front, all existing elements shift right to make room:\n",
    "\n",
    "**BEFORE:**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Index | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |\n",
    "|-------|-------|----------|---------|--------|---------|----------|\n",
    "| **Food** | pizza | ice cream | burgers | tacos | pasta | chocolate |\n",
    "\n",
    "**AFTER:**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Index | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |\n",
    "|-------|--------|-------|----------|---------|--------|---------|----------|\n",
    "| **Food** | waffles | pizza | ice cream | burgers | tacos | pasta | chocolate |\n",
    "| **What happened** | NEW! | moved | moved | moved | moved | moved | moved |\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how everything shifts over by one position. This is why adding to the front can be slower than adding to the end when dealing with large arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps to complete:**\n",
    "1. Use `unshift()` to add a breakfast food to the front\n",
    "2. Print the list again to see the change\n",
    "3. Check the length again (should be 7 if all previous steps were followed)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question to consider:** What happens to the indices of the existing elements after using `unshift()`?\n",

    "   - Print out the temperature for Monday (index 0)\n",
    "   - Print out the temperature for Friday (index 4)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Find the weekly average**:\n",
    "   - Calculate the average of all temperatures\n",
    "   - Hint: Add them all up and divide by 7\n",
    "   - You can do this with individual variables, a loop, or array methods\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Find the hottest day**:\n",
    "   - Find the highest temperature in the array\n",
    "   - Try using JavaScript's built-in `Math.max()` with the spread operator: `Math.max(...weekTemps)`\n",
    "   - Print the result\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Temperature check**:\n",
    "   - Use an if/else statement to check if any day was above 80 degrees\n",
    "   - If yes, print \"It was hot this week!\"\n",
    "   - If no, print \"It was mild this week.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected output**: The code should display the Monday and Friday temperatures, the average temperature (with one decimal place if needed), the highest temperature, and the temperature message.\n",
    "\n",
