This is the original calculator (<https://pages.opencodingsociety.com/calculator>):


This is our new and improved version (<https://compsciteam.github.io/student/calculator>):

<hr>

### Our changes

We made multiple improvements and quality-of-life upgrades for the calculator. Hereâ€™s what we changed:

- **Added the division button**
  - Division was missing beforeâ€”now itâ€™s here!
  - All four basic operations are fully supported.

- **Right-aligned results**
  - Numbers now align to the right, just like on a real calculator.
  - Makes reading long numbers easier and cleaner.

- **Colored numbers**
  - Each number now has its own color to make the interface more lively.
  - Small visual change, but it makes using the calculator more fun.

- **Keyboard input**
  - Before, you had to click buttons to type numbers.
  - Now you can type directly on your keyboard, which speeds things up a lot.
