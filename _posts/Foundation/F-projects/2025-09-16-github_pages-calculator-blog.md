### Our changes

We made multiple improvements and quality-of-life upgrades for the calculator. Hereâ€™s what we changed:

- **Added the division button**
  - Division was missing beforeâ€”now itâ€™s here!
  - All four basic operations are fully supported.

- **Right-aligned results**
  - Numbers now align to the right, just like on a real calculator.
  - Makes reading long numbers easier and cleaner.

- **Colored numbers**
  - Each number now has its own color to make the interface more lively.
  - Small visual change, but it makes using the calculator more fun.

- **Keyboard input**
  - Before, you had to click buttons to type numbers.
  - Now you can type directly on your keyboard, which speeds things up a lot.

- **Square Root Operator**
  - Before, there was no operator to square root numbers
  - Now you can click a number, then the square root button and it'll give you the answer.

- **New 67 button**
  - Before, the only numbers you could put in were 0-9.
  - Now you can directly choose the number 67.
