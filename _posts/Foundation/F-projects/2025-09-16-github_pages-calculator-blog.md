This is the original calculator (<https://pages.opencodingsociety.com/calculator>):  

This is our new and improved version (<https://compsciteam.github.io/student/calculator>):

### Our changes

We didnâ€™t just patch the calculatorâ€”we made it easier, more natural, and closer to what people expect when they use a real calculator. Hereâ€™s how:

---

- **Added support for single-number operations**  
  - The old calculator could only handle two numbers.  
  - We added single-number functions like square (`xÂ²`) and square root (`âˆš9`).  
  - This makes the calculator more useful for students and quick everyday math.  

---

- **Fixed the missing division symbol**  
  - The division (Ã·) button was missing in the original.  
  - We added it, so now the calculator supports all four core operations.  
  - This makes it feel like a complete basic calculator instead of an unfinished one.  

---

- **Right-aligned the results**  
  - Real calculators display numbers aligned to the right.  
  - Right alignment makes long numbers easier to read.  
  - It also feels natural for anyone used to physical calculators.  
  - Checklist for this fix:  
    - [ ] Results are right aligned  
    - [ ] Results are still readable  
    - [ ] Results are still correct  

---

- **Changed the number colors**  
  - The original calculator looked plain and dull.  
  - We gave each number a unique color to make the interface more lively.  
  - This small visual change makes using the calculator feel more fun and less boring.  

---

- **Made the numbers typable**  
  - Originally, the only way to input numbers was by clicking buttons.  
  - We added keyboard support, so you can now type numbers directly.  
  - This makes the calculator much faster and more convenient to use.
