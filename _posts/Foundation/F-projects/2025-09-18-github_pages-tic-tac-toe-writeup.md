    - Color looks better than black and white  
    - Added color: RED  
    - Added color: BLUE  
  
2. [Add player names](https://github.com/CompSciTeam/student/issues/18)
    - This creates a personal touch the game ðŸ˜ƒ 
  
3. [Adding exit button](https://github.com/CompSciTeam/student/issues/19)
    - This is for user convenience  
    - It's annoying for a player to have to finish a game if they need to leave for some reason
  
4. Add color to the tic-tac-toe position reference board [(#17)](https://github.com/CompSciTeam/student/issues/17)
    - This ensures the styling of the reference and gameboards are the same
5. Add color to names in the initial information display [(#17)]((https://github.com/CompSciTeam/student/issues/17))
    - Added color: GREEN
    - The addition of color puts importance on the names and makes the program look better
6. [Adding Unicode special characters](https://github.com/CompSciTeam/student/issues/20)
    - This makes the tic-tac-toe look a LOT better
    - This improves user satisfaction, and makes the program look more well-developed
