### Our changes

We have made multiple quality-of-life improvements and bugfixes for Snake. Below is a list of all the modifications we made.

- Changed "Points: ___" to "Apples: ___"
- Added WASD controls
  - Arrow keys could cause the page to scroll up and down. Adding WASD controls allowed for increased user flexibility and prevents this scrolling issue.
- Changed background theme
  - The background is, by default, checkered light and dark green. We added different color schemes to add even more flexibility, including light theme, dark theme, and **colorblind** mode.
- Added two new game modes!
  - We called the first game mode "Candied Apples", where the snake exponentially speeds up every time it eats an apple.
  - The second one is called "Fruit Frenzy", where a golden apple that bounces around can be eaten for 3 points. It has a 40% chance of spawning when you eat an apple.
- We made the snake blue and the apple red
- Cleaned up the settings UI significantly :)
  - See the above image
- Added two more game speeds
  - Honestly, the "Troll" and "Turtle" game modes were mainly just trolling. But if you're feeling daring, try to get a single apple at "Troll" speed with walls enabled >:)
