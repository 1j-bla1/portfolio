# James Blazek Retrospective


## Learnings from Computer Science
Through this trimester I have learned many things about coding and effective ways to use it. These strategies range from variables to kanban boards. In the beginning I was clueless of how computer science worked and struggled with getting my passwords set up. Now I have improved to the points where I can create many different linse of code. In this Blog I will show you some of the many things I have learned this trimester. 

### Sprint 1: Machine Setup and Basic Fundamentals

To begin I will start off with getting your machine setup. 

1. First I had to make a github account in order to gain access to repositories. Repositories are where all your code goes. You can make many different repositories which git hub helps keep you organized with.

2. Once I had my account I had to open Kali Linux through Kasm. By doing this I could finally access vscode where I could do all of my work. 

3. First when you enter Kali Linux you need to get into a repo so you can change the code. You first need to git clone a repository in order for you to make changes to it.

4. You do this by going in to the console and typing:

`git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git`

An example of me doing this is:

`Git clone https://github.com/1j-bla1/portfolio.git`

After git cloning you finally get the code to your local machine. Following my example you can then access the repo through typing:

`cd portfolio`

`code .`

Now you can make change to your code in the repo.

You then must learn to navigate through the folders of your new repo. Once you enter a file you want to make changes to you can change the code that is written there. Make sure to press control + s to save the changes you made.

Finally once you made your changes you can commit them to github. By committing your changes it will change your code in your repo allowing you to access and see your changes in a website. Once you click commit it will ask you to log in. Finally press sync changes and all of you coding changes will appear in your browser once the file uploads.

### Make Command

The make command is a simple but important tool when coding. By going to the console and typing make it will make a version of your project without actually committing it. This will allow you to see if you changes to the code worked before you commit the changes.

Simply type:

`Make`

Into the console log for it to work
### Problems I experianced with Engine and Files

Throughtout this trimester I had to solve many problems with my engine. Here are some of my struggles with my Kasm and Kali Linux

1. Kali Linux crashes. This happened when my Kali Linux crashed causing my session to be broken. I was then no longer able to access the file and it would never delete. I solved this problem by swapping to Ubunto Mobile while waiting for my session to be fixed

2. A more recenent problem I expierenced was my make not working. The problem was caused by a juypter notebook file that had a space after the title. This goes to show how precise you have to be when coding because a little error like that can ruin your code.

## Sprint 2: Snake Word and Word Game Hack

After we had all our machines set up and prepared we moved on to a new project. This project required us to make changes to already existing hacks and make it better

#### Snake Game Hack

For our snake game we made many different changes to the game. We made the looks of the game more visually appealing and added many different gamemodes for more fun.

### Word Game Hack 

For our word game we made a very large update to the game to make it more fun and enjoyable. I first added a updated finish screen since the old finish screen used to be a tiny text bubble that appaered.

## Sprint 3: Mansion Game

The mansion game was by far my biggest challenge. For this game we had to work together as a team to create our level. My team consisting of Anish, Samarath, Vihaan, Krish, and Pranay we decided that we were going to back a boss fight for the final level. This means that we had to put a lot of effort into this in order to make the game look good and to be fun for players.

There were many different concepts that we had to use in order to make our game in an effective manner. I will tell you our plan and concepts that we used to finish our game

### Plan for the Mansion Game
Our plan for the Mansion game was to make a final boss fight to escape the mansion. This was the final level for the mansion and needed to be a fun and intresting way to finish the game. We decided on a boss named the Reaper to be the final boss.

#### Pre-Boss Fight Room
In the pre-boss fight you find two zombie zpcs that will tell you different things. One talks about code while the other talks about the boss. The room also plays music which I added to the game. This makes the game more immersive. When you enter the double doors it will take you to the boss room.

The Reaper was a skeleton and and you fo


### Kanbans and Issues

Kanban boards are an effective and helpful tool for keeping your group on track when working on a project. They work by taking a bunch of issues and splitting them into different sections. Issues are problems or objectives that you need to complete in your code. 

Imagine it like a bunch of sticky notes. Each sticky note has a goal written on it. You then place it onto a board with different sections to show how far the sticky notes are to completion. This is what a kanban board is
